## 2025-03-31: Remove Unused Type Prefix Constants

### Summary
Removed the `LONG_TYPE_PREFIX` and `STRING_TYPE_PREFIX` constants from the `IdentifierType` class along with their related logic. These prefixes were being used for non-native type handling, which is no longer needed as the system now uses native database types.

### Changes
- Removed `LONG_TYPE_PREFIX` and `STRING_TYPE_PREFIX` constants
- Simplified `nullSafeGet` logic to directly parse values without prefix checking
- Updated `nullSafeSet` to use direct string representation without prefixes
- Simplified `disassemble` and `assemble` methods to use the string representation directly

### Rationale
According to the PRD, the system now uses native database types for ID storage:
- When configured for Long ID type, it uses BIGINT columns
- When configured for String ID type, it uses VARCHAR columns

The prefix-based approach for storing type information was only needed when both types might be stored in the same column type, which is no longer the case. This change simplifies the code and reduces the risk of serialization/deserialization issues.

### Testing
All tests continue to pass after these changes, confirming that the removed logic was indeed unused.
